# Detailing Platform — session rules

Read before working. These rules survive every `/clear`; chat instructions don't.

## Talking to the owner

The owner is not a coder. Explain things in plain language with everyday
analogies; define any technical term the first time it appears. Technical
detail belongs in files — chat messages must be understandable to a
non-programmer.

**Never hand the owner a decision without what they need to make it — in
about one paragraph.** "Your call", "owner decision" and "flagged for you"
are unfinished sentences. In a few plain sentences: what the thing actually
is (assume zero knowledge, use an analogy), what happens if they do it and
what happens if they don't, and your own recommendation with the reason.
Then stop. If it runs past a paragraph or two you are explaining the whole
system instead of the one choice — cut it back. Naming a risk is not
explaining it; if they still have to ask "so should I?", it failed.

## Ground rules

- Work on branch `claude/superbase-access-anj1h7`. NEVER commit or merge to
  `main` — main auto-deploys to production (detailingplatform.com).
- The owner's live business site (repo `carwashweb`, Supabase project
  `adtlnvihwrcqcasqcjwd`, Netlify, Resend domain andrewsdetail.com) takes
  real customers' money. Reads are allowed; writes only with the owner's
  explicit go-ahead for that specific action.
- Migrations are append-only. Never edit an existing one.
- Consequential writes go through edge functions, not the browser client.
- Never commit `app/.env.production`, or any credential.
- `reference/` is read-only — the old site kept as canon.

## Design

- VISUAL REDESIGN IN PROGRESS (owner decision 2026-08-28, see `DESIGN.md`).
  The old system `docs/design-system.md` ("Raking Light") is deprecated as
  identity — evidence and anti-reference only. Do not apply it or polish
  toward it. Backend, content, copy facts, and accessibility floors are
  kept; only the visual world is being replaced.
- During the redesign phase, direction-generating design skills ARE
  allowed — that phase is their job. Once the new direction is chosen and
  written into a rewritten `docs/design-system.md` (with rewritten design
  tests), the skill-collision rule locks back in: auditors and appliers
  only, no more direction-inventing.
- The old design tests (composition, design-contrast) encode the OLD
  system; expect them to be rewritten with the new one. Don't contort new
  work to pass old-look tests.
- Never-defaults (in addition to the design system): Inter/Roboto/Arial/
  system-ui/Space Grotesk as design choices; purple-blue gradients on
  white; three evenly spaced cards; numbered markers on non-sequences;
  "modern and clean"-style copy. See `docs/design-knowledge.md`.
- Visual work is verified by LOOKING: screenshot 392px / 768px / 1440x900,
  both themes, console read, compared against the design system. Retints
  are checked per tenant accent, including extremes.
- **Imagery: never a grey placeholder box.** An Unsplash connector is
  wired up and confirmed working 2026-08-29 (`search_photos`; "car
  detailing" returns ~4,800 real photos). Use it for mockups, the demo
  business, and anything a tenant has not supplied. If it cannot find the
  right shot, ASK THE OWNER — they have said plainly they will go and
  source images rather than have work limited by what is to hand. Asking
  is cheaper than settling.

## Verification

- Finish every session: `node tests/composition.test.mjs`,
  `design-contrast`, `landing-pricing`, `route-contract` from repo root —
  credential-free, all must pass. The other 7 tests need env vars from
  root `.env`.
- Report what was observed, never "this should work."

## Process

- One queue prompt per session; commit before the next; `/clear` and
  restart a session that goes sideways.
- **Ping the owner's phone when the work is done.** Send a PushNotification
  at the end of every session — whenever you hand over, ask for a decision,
  or stop needing them to look. They are often away from the screen while a
  session runs. Harmless when they are not on a remote session; do it
  anyway rather than guessing.
- **Clear at the work boundary, not at a token count.** A session covers ONE
  roadmap item. When that item is finished AND nothing is left hanging — no
  unanswered question, no decision handed to the owner they have not
  answered, no "I'll look at that next" — say "Safe to clear." and hand
  over. Never start a second item in the same session: that is what the
  clear is for. Finishing a *sub-part* is not a boundary, and neither is
  "the code works" — chase the loose ends first.

  If a decision is pending, the session is not over. Keep working on
  everything that does not depend on it.

  **Context size is advisory, not a trigger.** `node scripts/context-check.mjs`
  reads the live transcript and prints real usage; quality is reported to
  degrade somewhere past ~300k. Treat that as a reason to be economical and
  to avoid picking up anything new — never as a reason to abandon the item
  mid-flight. If you are far past it and the item genuinely cannot finish,
  say so plainly and make the handoff carry every unresolved thread,
  because the next session starts cold on whatever the prompt names.

  Before clearing, write anything that exists only in this chat into a
  file — a thread that lives only in the conversation dies at the clear.
  Then give them a short prompt to paste into the next session, in a plain
  fenced block (no language tag — it is not a shell command). Fill it from
  `docs/roadmap.md`: the next unchecked item, and its row in that file's
  "Which skills each phase uses" table.

  ```
  Next: roadmap <N.N> — <one line, plain words>.
  Read CLAUDE.md, then PROJECT-STATE.md and docs/roadmap.md.
  Skills: <from the roadmap table>. <"No design skills — not visual." or,
  if it is visual, "Anti-slop floor: docs/design-knowledge.md §1 and the
  never-defaults in CLAUDE.md.">
  Watch out: <the one thing that isn't obvious from the files, or omit>.
  Don't wrap up when the code works — surface what's still unanswered, chase
  it down, and only say "Safe to clear." once nothing is left hanging.
  ```

  Keep it five lines or fewer. It is a pointer at the files, not a summary
  of them — the files are what survive the clear. The last line is not
  boilerplate: the owner clears BETWEEN roadmap items, so a session that
  signs off with loose ends buries them — the next session starts on a new
  item and never picks them up.

  **The prompt IS the sign-off. It only ever appears together with "Safe to
  clear."** Never hand over a next-session prompt and then say the session
  is not finished — a prompt in the chat reads as "you are done here, go
  clear", so pairing it with "don't clear yet" gives two opposite
  instructions and the owner acts on the wrong one. If either half is
  missing, both are.

  **When the session is blocked on the owner** — a question asked, a
  decision handed over, an OWNER roadmap item — finish everything that
  does not depend on the answer, write it all to files, commit, and end
  with the ask ALONE. No prompt, no sign-off. The session stays open. When
  the owner answers, write their answer into the file it belongs in, finish
  the item, and only then give "Safe to clear." and the prompt together.
  An answer that exists only in the chat has not been captured yet, and
  that is exactly the thread the clear would destroy.
- Plan before building anything large; stop for approval.
- Smallest possible diff; no unrequested refactors, deps, files, renames.
- Stuck twice on one bug: stop editing, write hypothesis + evidence +
  unchecked assumptions, list three causes.
- **Write for a coding agent that is not Claude.** The owner expects to
  move to OpenAI's coding agent in roughly a month (stated 2026-08-29).
  Every durable decision therefore lives in plain markdown in the repo,
  never in a tool-specific mechanism — no skills, no hooks, no
  assistant-side memory holding anything that matters. Audited 2026-08-29:
  the ONLY tool-specific file in the repo is `.claude/settings.json`
  (permissions), and all 20+ knowledge files are portable markdown. Keep
  it that way and the migration stays close to free. See DECISIONS.md.

## Context (read these, in this order, when new)

1. `PROJECT-STATE.md` — full state briefing
2. `docs/HANDOFF.md` — architecture + open threads
3. `DECISIONS.md` — every judgment call and why
4. `docs/ux-audit.md` — the dashboard audit and its status
5. `docs/design-knowledge.md` — design/process research transfer

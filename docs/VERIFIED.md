# VERIFIED — the checked-off ledger

**Read this BEFORE you measure anything.** Created 2026-09-13 at `130ae94`.

## THE RULE

**A row here is un-proven by a CHANGE, never by age.** A measurement taken three
weeks ago against code nothing has touched since is still true; a measurement
taken an hour ago against a file somebody has edited since is not.

**So before re-measuring anything in this file, run its row's own command:**

```bash
git diff --name-only <row commit>..HEAD -- <row paths>
```

**Empty output means DO NOT RE-MEASURE.** Cite the row and move on. Output means
the row is stale for exactly the surface those paths cover — re-measure that, not
the whole product.

**Adding a row** means recording four things: what was proven (in numbers, not
adjectives), when, at which commit, and which paths would invalidate it. A row
without paths is not a row, because nobody can ever retire it.

**A row is never deleted.** A row disproved by a later measurement is marked
disproved with the new figure beside it — the reversal is usually the
load-bearing part.

## 1 · PROVEN CLEAN — Andrew's own measurements, 2026-09-13, at `130ae94`

**What was proven, identically on all three rows:** zero overlapping tap-target
pairs and no sideways scroll, at **1440 / 1024 / 768 / 392 / 320**.

| surface | proven | at | invalidated by a change to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Back office, all five tabs** | zero overlapping pairs, no sideways scroll at all five widths | 2026-09-13, `130ae94` | `app/src/admin/**`, `app/src/theme.css` |
| **Detailer dashboard, all five tabs** | same | 2026-09-13, `130ae94` | `app/src/screens/**`, `app/src/components/**`, `app/src/theme.css` |
| **Customer booking, steps 1–5** | same | 2026-09-13, `130ae94` | `app/src/book/**` |

**A NOTE ON THE PATHS, because getting them wrong retires a row that is still
good:** the dashboard row was handed over as `app/src/app/**`. **That directory
does not exist** — the five tabs live in `app/src/screens/` (`Today`, `Calendar`,
`Clients`, `Money`, `Business`) and draw most of their controls from
`app/src/components/`. Both are listed above. The shared stylesheet is
`app/src/theme.css`; `app/src/admin/admin.css` shares its TOKENS and no rule, so
a change to one does not invalidate the other's row.

```bash
# back office
git diff --name-only 130ae94..HEAD -- app/src/admin app/src/theme.css
# dashboard
git diff --name-only 130ae94..HEAD -- app/src/screens app/src/components app/src/theme.css
# booking
git diff --name-only 130ae94..HEAD -- app/src/book
```

## 2 · LOOKS BROKEN BUT PASSES — NEVER RE-REPORT ANY OF THESE FIVE

**Andrew reported all five as faults and withdrew each one after measuring
properly.** This section exists so the next session does not pay to make the same
five mistakes. Every one of them is a `getBoundingClientRect` reading arguing with
a real hit area, which is trap (n): **a rect cannot measure a target.**

| what it looks like | what it actually is |
|---|---|
| **`.btn.sm` is 38px** — under the 44 floor | its `::after` carries the hit area to **44.4**. Passes. |
| **`.btn.sm.icon` is 38×44** | **`PRODUCT.md`'s own recorded exception.** Andrew's to reopen, nobody else's. |
| **Calendar day cells are `<div>`s** — not buttons | they carry `role="button"` and `tabindex="0"` and measure **46.5**. Passes. |
| **Booking checkboxes are 22px** | 22px MARK inside a **44px** target, with **67px** labels. The painted thing is not the target. |
| **The `Cerrar` (Close) button is 36px** | its `::after` gives **46**. Passes. |

**The general form, and it is why this section is worth more than the five rows
in it:** a measurement that says a control is too small is a measurement of the
PAINT. Probe with `elementFromPoint` at centre and ±4, ±10, ±15 before writing
anything down.

## 3 · STILL OPEN — lane B's, not measured away

Real, under 44, and nothing here has been fixed. **Lane B owns `app/src/**`**, so
a lane C or lane A session records these and does not touch them.

| where | what | measured |
|---|---|---|
| Clients tab | 3 sort chips | **36px** |
| Money tab | 5 range chips | **36px** |
| Money tab | 2 payment rows | **43.6px** |

Invalidated by: `app/src/screens/Clients.jsx`, `app/src/screens/Money.jsx`,
`app/src/components/AdvancedMoney.jsx`, `app/src/theme.css`.

## 4 · FROZEN — recorded, deliberately not fixed

**These are real and they are not being repaired.** Recording them is the
decision, not a step towards one. Do not open them without Andrew saying so, and
do not re-report them as new findings.

| where | what | measured |
|---|---|---|
| Back office → Detailers | 7 filter chips, **no `::after`** | **29.4px**, rows **35.4px** apart |
| Back office | Sign out | **17.4px** |
| Back office | three buttons | **34.1px** |

Invalidated by: `app/src/admin/**`, `app/src/theme.css`.

**Why frozen and the dashboard is not:** the back office has exactly one user and
he is at a desk with a mouse. The detailer dashboard has detailers on phones.

## 5 · CHECKED AND NOT A PROBLEM — five things that look like defects and are not

Each of these was investigated to a conclusion. **Do not re-investigate.**

- **`app/public/map.html` owes no attribution.** It is the **page-review index**,
  not a map. The name is the whole reason it reads as one.
- **Geoapify is not wired in anywhere yet**, so nothing in this product is
  missing its credit today. The attribution requirement is real and lands the day
  that work starts — `ROADMAP.md` § 6, already settled, build exactly that.
- **The Detailers tab's 15 unfinished setups are test rows.** Growth counts **1
  real detailer**, which is the honest figure. A session that reads "15 businesses
  stalled in setup" as a product problem is reading fixtures.
- **`send-owner-reminders` is running inside its threshold.** What is broken is
  different and smaller: **the watchdog's mails stopped, and it never mailed to
  say it had recovered.** The sweep is fine; the thing that tells you the sweep is
  fine is not.
- **Booking links in delivered TEST emails 404 because the test suite deletes its
  own rows.** The link was correct when it was sent. This is not a URL-builder
  bug and not a `PLATFORM_URL` bug.

## HOW THIS FILE EARNS ITS KEEP

Andrew paid for every number above once. **The cost of this file is one `git
diff --name-only`; the cost of not having it is a full re-measure of five widths
across fifteen screens, plus the five withdrawn findings in § 2 being reported a
second time.** That is the arithmetic — see `docs/ECONOMY.md`.
